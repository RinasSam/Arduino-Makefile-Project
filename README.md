# Arduino-Makefile-Project
This is a simple makefile setup for Arduino development.

# Getting Started:
At the start of the Makefile, change the `ARDUINO_DIR` value to the topmost directory of the Arduino installation.
Change the value of `MAIN_SKETCH` to be the name of your sketch.

# TODO:
- Implement support for the other Arduino libraries.
- Implement support for other Arduino variants.
